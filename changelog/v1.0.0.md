Changelog NEAT v1.0
===================

*1. `compilechannels` is extended to `neatmodels` command*
---------------------------------------------------------
Instead of compiling channels for simulations with `compilechannels`, the functionality to export models to simulators has been vastly extended through the `neatmodels` command. This implements functionality to install collections of channels, defined `neat.IonChannel`'s as a NEAT model (i.e. through `neatmodels install <cmd options>`), to list installed models (`neatmodels list <cmd options>`) and to uninstall models (`neatmodels uninstall <cmd options>`). After installing NEAT, type `neatmodels -h` in the terminal to see an overview of the options

*2. NEST compatibility*
----------------------
`neat.CompartmentTree`'s can now be simulated in NEST. Collection of channels can be installed in the same way as for NEURON, through the `neatmodels install` terminal command, except that the option `-s nest` is then invoked with the command. The ionchannels are than converted into NESTML code that is converted into an efficient compartmental modeling C++ code in NEST.

There are three steps towards implementing such a NEST model:
1. Compile the NEST compartmental model
    ```console
    neatmodels install my_nest_model_name -s nest -p my_channels.py
    ```
2. In the python session, load the NEST model in NEAT
    ```python
    neat.load_nest_model("my_nest_model_name")
    ```
3. In the same python session, create a `neat.NestCompartmentTree` from an existing `neat.CompartmentTree` and call `init_model()`
    ```python
    nest_sim_tree = neat.NestCompartmentTree(existing_compartment_tree)
    nest_model = nest_sim_tree.init_model("my_nest_model_name")
    ```

*3. Copy construction*
--------------------
Creating new trees from already existing trees can now be done directly by the constructor.
I.e., in NEAT 0.9.2, we would create a new tree from an existing one as follows
```python
new_tree = old_tree.__copy__(new_tree=NewTreeClass())
```

In NEAT 1.0.0, we can do
```python
new_tree = NewTreeClass(old_tree)
```

*4. Removal of `neat.createReducedNeuronModel()`*
-----------------------------------------------
The original procedure in NEAT 0.9.2 to instantiate a reduced NEURON model for simulations involved calling a standalone function `neat.createReducedNeuronModel()`, i.e.:
```python
neuron_sim_tree = neat.createReducedNeuronModel(compartment_tree)
```
To harmonize creation of reduced compartmental NEURON simulation trees with all other tree classes, the compartment tree is now simply provided to the constructor of `NeuronCompartmentTree`.
```python
neuron_sim_tree = neat.NeuronCompartmentTree(compartment_tree)
```

*5. Conversion of function names to snake_case*
-----------------------------------------------
All function names have been converted from `smallCamelCase` to `snake_case`.

*6. Treetype is now a context manager*
-------------------------------------
To speed up computations, `neat.MorphTree`'s and derived tree classes allow the definition of a more coarse-grained tree, the computational tree. To toggle between which tree is active, the `treetype` attribute needed to be set to either 'computational' or 'original'. This error-prone procedure has been replaced by a context manager, one can do:
```python
with tree.as_computational_tree:
    # do something on computational tree
```
NEAT also provides the `computational_tree_decorator` and `computational_tree_decorator` to provide the certainty that functions always operate on a specific tree.

*7. Compute linear response kernels in the time domain through `neat.GreensTreeTime`*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A new tree class, `neat.GreensTreeTime`, supports automatic conversion of the frequency domain kernels into the time domain, so there is no more need to rely on `neat.FourierQuadrature`. The conversion algorithm is chosing optimally for the specific kernel, using vector fitting [[Gustavsen and Semlyen, 2003, 10.1109/61.660941]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/660941) when an input resistance kernel is computed, and and explicit quadrature method with a squared-cosine window when it is a transfer resistance kernel. 

*8. Improved cacheing*
----------------------
Cacheing is improved and more robust through the use of hashing, taking into account a representation string that features all attributes of the tree and all its nodes, so that different trees will always have different hashes. Specific cachetrees have been create to allow the cacheing of expensive computations:
* `neat.EquilibriumTree`: cached equilibrium voltage calculation through NEURON simulation
* `neat.CachedGreensTree`: cached evaluation of response kernels in frequency domain
* `neat.CachedGreensTreeTime`: cached evaluation of response kernels in time domain
* `neat.CachedSOVTree`: cached evaluation of separation of variables expansion

*9. Consistent naming conventions across tree types*
---------------------------------------------------
Naming conventions for individual impedances and impulse response kernels, and impedance and impulse response kernel matrices have been made consistent across tree classes.
I.e. `{TreeClass}.calc_zf()` for frequency domain impedance, `{TreeClass}.calc_zt()` for time domain impulse response kernel, and `{TreeClass}.calc_impedance_matrix()`
`{TreeClass}.calc_impulse_response_matrix()` for the respective matrices.

*10. Non-API-affecting changes*
----------------------------
1. The `neat.CompartmentFitter` is now a tree class, inheriting from `neat.EquilibriumTree`. This does not affect syntax.
2. The install system has migrated to `pyproject.toml`.
3. Bugfixes in finite difference approximation (i.e. in `PhysTree.create_finite_difference_tree()`).
4. Bugfixes in location distribution functions from `MorphTree`.
